# ðŸ“§ Project-2: Gmailing via MCP Integration

This project enables users to automate the job application process by leveraging Gmail and LinkedIn data through MCP (Multi-Channel Prompting) integration. It uses Pipedream as the backend server and Cursor IDE as the user interface for AI prompt execution. The system fetches personal LinkedIn details, generates a cover letter, and sends everything to a specified email addressâ€”all from a single prompt.
